# One-Fourth-Labs-
One Fourth Labs Internship Programming Round  1
I got an accuracy of 85.60 % for all the three tasks of the programming round.
I used a Convutional Neural Network model to train the training dataset for all the three tasks and then used the model created to test the test dataset with a variable named y_pred to predict the values. Later id used the the if statements to classify the digits and letters in the task 1 and even/odd digits and vowels/consonents letters in the task 2.
